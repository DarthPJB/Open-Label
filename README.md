# Open-Label
An open source format and method for the creation of physical labelling, for use in inventory management at small and large scale, such all beings may benefit.

## Preamble

This document is laid out so it might contain as much information as to this project as I am able to provide; yet give the most important information quickly.

This project is to make a standard label, that normal people may apply and adapt to their own needs. It is a standard only so far as the concept and layout of the label meets a generic specification - while I encourage all persons to commit towards this meaningful endeavour, please make use of this idea however you see fit.

The [Rationale](#rationale) Section below provides a description, *example question*, **example answer pattern**; this is to quickly explain the motivations of each step, and how they could apply to the real world.

The [Fabrication](#fabrication) Section discusses methods of fabricating labels.

The [Automation](#automation) section explains the process by which one might generate parametric labels to this specification.

## Rationale
> It is my duty as the caretaker of a space to ensure beings may use it safely and efficiently, to this aim I will label the items and containers in this space I reside.

Sentient Beings require physical things, these things are by their nature infinite in variance, yet abide by certain patterns we associate words and images with.

A Spanner is such a thing, also known by the name *wrench* in the language of English, and doubtless other names in the infinite we exist within.

 - *"How might I find a Spanner, or place for a wrench?"* - **A box may contain many things, A box labelled spanners should contain spanners.**

If only words are used in labels, confusion may arise, to this end we should include an example image, icon, or otherwise obvious recognisable image.

 - *"I need an item, I do not know it's name?"* - **Can you see the likeness of the item among these many images upon many boxes?**

The future is the infinite in infinite combination, I cannot tell what might change, space should exist to amend the label later, by hand if needs be.

 - *"To what end does this screwdriver box contain screws?"* - **written upon the box are the words 'Screws For EBike Inside'**

In every pattern, we might discern more patterns, this is classification - a label should contain space for such sub-division of items.

 - *"Where will I find a 13mm grommit?"* **Inside the Grommit containers there are smaller containers, upon one is written 13mm**

Specific Items might be a danger to beings, either through specific application or the nature of the item, This must be displayed also, as might notes on usage.

 - *"How will I know what in this place might harm me?"* **Those containers with icons of danger should be handled with care, mindful attention be paid to writing upon them**

More details are often needed than a single label can hold, in this way a section of label should contain image-references to knowledge.

 - *"Where might I order more of this item?"* **Scan the QR-code with a smartphone, or copy the identifying code by hand**

Colour and pattern, and texture, can relay information, each colour must match a pattern for those colour-blind, braille should be added where possible.

  - *"Which containers here hold gasses?"* **Those with blue-edges, beware those with red-inside they may combust**

## Fabrication

I haven't done this yet.
